**What is this?**

Some exercises I did for Matt Greencroft's course [Java Application Performance and Memory Management](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-application-performance-and-memory-management/).

**What did I learn?**

- How JIT compilation and the code cache really works
- Differences between C1 and C2 compilers
- Inner workings of the stack and the heap
- Metaspace
- String pool
- Java Mission Control
- Java Flight Recorder

**How was the course?**

Too monotone for my taste, but it gets the job done. I feel that I've learned a lot of in-depth knowledge about the Java.
