**What is this?**

Some exercises I did for Matt Greencroft's course [Java Application Performance and Memory Management](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-application-performance-and-memory-management/).

**What did I learn?**

- How JIT compilation and the code cache really works
- Differences between C1 and C2 compilers
- Inner workings of the stack and the heap
- Metaspace
- String pool
- Java Mission Control
- Java Flight Recorder

**How was the course?**

Too monotone for my taste, but it gets the job done. I feel that I've learned a lot of in-depth knowledge about the Java.

**Additional info**

For the past six years I've taken a lot of courses in my free time. Sadly, I never thought about compiling them into a list. Since 2019, I've been trying to write down (and rate) every new course I take. You can see it [here](https://github.com/abrahammenendez/courses/).
